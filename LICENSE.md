## Me

Hey, I'm rotwall, and I'm responsible for the coding and designing of this webpage. Here's some links if you want to find out more about me or see what else I'm working on:

## Videocult

Rain World is a property of Videocult, and I am not affiliated with Videocult or Akupara Games in any way. All assets inside of the threat_music and region_backgrounds folders were created by members of Videocult as well as others who worked on the Downpour and Watcher. All base game threat themes can be found in the official [Rain World ost](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuX1dXf1Zu0kHEc_TrwqgbKaEkWJOAqlN). All audio files and images were either ripped from the game using [AssetRipper](https://assetripper.github.io/AssetRipper/) or were provided by the [official Rain World wiki](https://rainworld.miraheze.org/wiki/Official_Art).

## Fonts

The Rodondo font (the one used as the title font for Rain World) was created by @ollywood on twitter and uploaded to [dafont.com](https://www.dafont.com/rodondo.font).

The Rain World menu font was recreated by DANNYY1TDM on [fontstruct](https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/2392353/rain-world-menu).

## Code

The visualizer present in the music screen was made by following a tutorial created by [QuickCodingTuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb6C1XNqJzA) on YouTube.

I also have to give credit to Barrett Sonntag for creating a [CSS filter generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp), making finding the filters to use for changing the color of images a hell of a lot easier.

# *Final Statement*
I want to give one last thank you to the brilliant minds within Videocult, Akupara Games, and the MSC and Watcher dev teams for making the most influential video game I've ever played. I've been obsessed with Rain World ever since I first played it in 2021, and my love for it has hardly waned since. This game has been a source of inspiration for countless stories, ideas, games and what-have-you that I've been conjuring up in my head over these past few years. I think it's safe to say that this game has played a huge role in turning me into the person I am today. In making this project, I'm finally able to give back to this game and its community in my own unique way, and that in itself is a blessing I'll never take for granted. Again, thank you Rain World devs and to everyone who's helped and supported me along this journey. And a special thanks to *you* for taking the time to read this and check out Threatmixer. I hope you will enjoy, or have enjoyed, using this webpage as much as I did making it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
